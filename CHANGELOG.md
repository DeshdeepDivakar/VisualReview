# Changelog

## 0.1.1

### Features and improvements
* Projects are now created on the fly during a test run, instead of having to create them manually beforehand. Thanks [wietsevennema](https://github.com/wietsevenema) !
* Added delete buttons for suites and links
* Breadcrumb navigation now disables link to the currently viewed page for increased clarity.
* Page title now contains more information on what's being shown on the page, instead of just 'VisualReview'.
* Various user interface tweaks

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where suites could no longer be added to a project when the user already tried to run a test against a non-existing project. ([#39](https://github.com/xebia/VisualReview/issues/39))
